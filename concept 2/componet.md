🎨 Using Figma Components for Creative Icons and Functionalities

✨ What Are Components in Figma? 🔧
Components are reusable building blocks in Figma. They allow you to:
🧩 Divide your design into smaller, manageable pieces
🎨 Quickly update colors, shapes, and layouts across your project
🚀 Create consistent and scalable designs easily
🎨 Creating Creative Icons and Functionalities 🎯
When designing icons and features in Figma:

🎨 Design your base icon or UI element.
➡️ Convert it into a Component (Right-click ➔ Create Component or Ctrl + Alt + K).
📦 Use Instances across your designs.
🖌️ Customize Instances while keeping them linked to the master component.

🎨 Changing Color, Shape, and More 🛠️
When you modify a Main Component:
🎨 Change Colors (for example, dark mode toggle)
🟠 Adjust Shapes (rounded, square, pill-shaped)
🖱️ Add States (hover, active, pressed) using Variants
🔁 Auto-sync updates across all instances automatically

🔄 Implementing Changes to Components ⚡
Steps:
✏️ Edit the Master Component.
🌟 Create Variants for different states.
📚 Publish to a Team Library for collaboration across projects.
